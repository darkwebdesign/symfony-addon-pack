# Form Field Types

A form is composed of fields, each of which are built with the help of a field type (e.g. `TextType`,
`ChoiceType`, etc.). The Symfony Add-on Pack comes with additional field types that can be used in your
application.

## Supported Field Types

The following field types are available:

### Date and Time Fields

* [BirthdayType](types/birthday-type.html)

### Other Fields

* [BooleanType](types/boolean-type.html)
* [EntityType](types/entity-type.html)
* [UnstructuredType](types/unstructured-type.html)
