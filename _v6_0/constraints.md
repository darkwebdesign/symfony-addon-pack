# Validation Constraints

The Symfony Validator is designed to validate objects against constraints. In real life, a constraint could
be: "The cake must not be burned". In Symfony, constraints are similar: They are assertions that a
condition is true.

## Supported Constraints

The following constraints are available:

### String Constraints

* [Json](constraints/json.html) (deprecated)

### Number Constraints

* [Bsn](constraints/bsn.html)

### Collection Constraints

* [Collection](constraints/collection.html)
