# UnstructuredType

This form field type is used to handle unstructured data.

{: .info }
Prior to Symfony Forms 3.4.21, it was possible to submit unstructured data to *any* form field type.
This was considered a security hole and therefore patched, leaving a lot of people with no easy
alternative to handle unstructured data in their forms. This form field type has been created to
support unstructured data again.

Overridden options:

* [compound](#compound)
* [multiple](#multiple)

Parent type:

* [FormType](http://symfony.com/doc/5.0/reference/forms/types/form.html)

## Basic Usage

```php
$builder->add('data', UnstructuredType::class);
```

### compound

**type**: `boolean` **value**: `false`

This option is managed internally and can not be changed.

### multiple
