# Form Field Event Subscribers

A form is composed of fields, each of which are built with the help of a field type (e.g. `TextType`,
`ChoiceType`, etc.). The Symfony Add-on Pack comes with additional field event subscribers that can be
used in your application.

## Supported Field Event Subscribers

The following field event subscribers are available:
